Project Title

Exposing the Truth: Advanced Fake News Detection Powered by NLP


---

Objective

To design and implement a system that accurately detects fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, thereby helping combat misinformation and promote truth.


---

Problem Statement

The rise of social media and digital journalism has made the spread of fake news easier and faster. Manual detection is inefficient and biased. A reliable, automated solution is needed to identify and flag deceptive or manipulated content.


---

Key Features

Fake news classification (real vs. fake)

Sentiment and emotion analysis

Source credibility scoring

Explainable AI (XAI) for model decisions

Real-time article/news input and classification



---

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (BERT/DistilBERT), Pandas, NumPy

Frameworks: Flask or Streamlit (for web app interface)

Database: MongoDB or SQLite

Deployment: Heroku or AWS



---

Data Sources

Kaggle Fake News Dataset

LIAR dataset (short statements labeled for truthfulness)

Credibility corpora from fact-checking sites like PolitiFact or Snopes



---

Modules

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization

TF-IDF or word embeddings (BERT)



2. Feature Engineering

Linguistic features (e.g., exaggeration, sentiment)

Source metadata



3. Model Training

ML models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

Deep learning models: LSTM, BERT



4. Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC



5. Interface

Simple UI to paste articles or links

Display classification, probability score, and model explanation





---

Outcomes

A tool to identify fake news with high accuracy

Insights into linguistic patterns of misinformation

Enhanced public awareness of fake news indicators



---

Future Enhancements

Multilingual support

Browser extension for real-time checking

Integration with social media platforms
